% A Simple Map

Creating a map typically involves 3 steps:

  * Creating a container, an `Html` element for embedding the map object.

  * Initializing the map and attaching it to the container.

  * Setting properties, wiring events and adding shapes or controls to the
    attached map.

To initialize the map you need to supply your bing map key. More information on
how to retrieve a Bing Maps key is found at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx.


The following example creates and initializes a simple map:

    #fsharp
    [<JavaScript>]
	let MyCredentials = "Your Bing Maps Key"
	
	[<JavaScript>]
    let MapElement () =
        Div []
        |>! OnAfterRender (fun el ->
            let options =
                Bing.MapOptions(
                    Credentials = MyCredentials,
                    Width = 400,
                    Height = 400
                )
            let map = Bing.Map(el.Body, options)
            map.SetMapType(MapTypeId.Birdseye)
        )

It is necessary to initialize the map using the `OnAfterRender` method since the
Bing Maps API requires that the container element is attached to the DOM before
the map is initialized. Doing the Map initialization after the widget rendering makes
sure that this condition holds.

The method `LoadMap` is overloaded to support different configurations. You can change the
default location of the map by specifying a different latitude and longitude. This is
done through the `VELatLong` class.

    #fsharp 
    [<JavaScript>]
    let LatLongProperties(n: int) =
        Test (fun map ->
            let location = new Maps.VELatLong(0.,0.)
            location.Latitude <- 47.6
            location.Longitude <- -122.33 
            map.LoadMap(location, 10, Maps.VEMapStyle.Hybrid))

This example shows how you can initialize the VELatLong components directly from the
constructor or using mutation. This time we also used a 10x zoom and a `Hybrid` style
for the map.
