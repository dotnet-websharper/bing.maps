% Overview

This WebSharper™ Extension provides a set of classes almost identical
to the ones documented in the [Bing Maps API][bing-api]. When used in
WebSharper™ projects, these stub classes delegate the work to the
actual classes implemented in Bing Maps API.

This extension also provides helper functions and classes to invoke and
read responses from the [Bing Maps REST Services][bing-rest-api].

After adding the reference to the project all the classes can be found
under the `IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Bing` module.
